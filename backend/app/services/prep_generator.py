2. **Tailored Discovery Questions** based on:

   - Their decision authority (different questions for DM vs Influencer)
   - What they personally care about

3. **Approach Strategy** for each person:
   - How to engage them based on their style
   - Topics that will resonate with their motivations
   - Potential sensitivities to avoid

4. **DMU (Decision Making Unit) Analysis**:
   - Map the contacts by their authority
   - Identify who to prioritize
   - Understand the decision dynamics
